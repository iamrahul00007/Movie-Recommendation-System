# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on a user-selected title. It leverages TF-IDF vectorization of movie metadata (such as genres, keywords, cast, director, and overview) and computes pairwise similarity using kernels like cosine similarity or sigmoid kernel.
